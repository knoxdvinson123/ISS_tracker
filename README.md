# ISS Tracker (python)
Welcome to the ISS Tracker project! This Python application tracks the location of the International Space Station (ISS) using a public API and plots its position on the Earth's longitude and latitude. This project was a fun and quick way to combine my love for computer science and space.

## Introduction
The ISS Tracker project is a simple yet engaging application that fetches the current location of the ISS and plots its position on a map. The project uses a public API to retrieve real-time data about the ISS's position. This project was inspired by my passion for space and computer science, and it serves as an introductory step towards integrating these two fields.
